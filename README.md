### what is vim?
on October 9, [@eigenbom](https://twitter.com/eigenbom) posted a [tweet](https://twitter.com/eigenbom/status/1182059055382052864) challenging users to design and fit the rules of a short tabletop RPG into a single tweet. [vim was my response.](https://twitter.com/sporeball/status/1182079746785439745)

tabletop RPGs are all well and good, but i wanted to create a version of vim that did without all that graph paper &mdash; and this is it.

### why is commit [`9360d3e`](https://github.com/sporeball/vim/commit/9360d3e1dda9f0380c7a50a17cd82a7492b1d42c) labeled "code migration"?

at the beginning of its development cycle, i hosted vim using the fantastic [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net), and i didn't originally plan on changing that. however, as vim started to grow, i decided that moving it to GitHub might be a better choice.

[`9360d3e`](https://github.com/sporeball/vim/commit/9360d3e1dda9f0380c7a50a17cd82a7492b1d42c) is a near-identical copy of the fiddle's final revision, except with all audio removed and a couple of other minor changes made. in the interest of transparency, i've left the original fiddle [here](https://jsfiddle.net/sporeball/dyaq1p9k).

if you're curious, here is a rough outline of the original fiddle's history:
* [revision 1](https://jsfiddle.net/sporeball/dyaq1p9k/1): vim begins with a blank canvas.
* [revision 4](https://jsfiddle.net/sporeball/dyaq1p9k/4): player tags and a grid are added.
* [revision 12](https://jsfiddle.net/sporeball/dyaq1p9k/12): the menu is completed, and player count selectable.
* [revision 15](https://jsfiddle.net/sporeball/dyaq1p9k/15): handmade functions for drawing are experimented with for the first time.
* [revision 20](https://jsfiddle.net/sporeball/dyaq1p9k/20): selecting player count now draws the correct number of players into the center of the grid.
* [revision 34](https://jsfiddle.net/sporeball/dyaq1p9k/34): after much revision, the logic behind the die is pretty much completed.
* [revision 37](https://jsfiddle.net/sporeball/dyaq1p9k/37): rolling the die causes the UI to cycle through each player in succession.
* [revision 44](https://jsfiddle.net/sporeball/dyaq1p9k/44): sounds are added for the first time, with the help of [Howler.js](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js).
* [revision 46](https://jsfiddle.net/sporeball/dyaq1p9k/46): sounds to go along with the revamped menu are added.
* [revision 53](https://jsfiddle.net/sporeball/dyaq1p9k/53): i stop tinkering with the game's sounds and perform the "code migration". this is the last revision of the original fiddle.
